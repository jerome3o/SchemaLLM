# SchemaLLM

This is an attempt at making an LLM completion API that allows for submition of a JSONSchema (and eventually other schema languages) along side your prompt, and reliably returns a result that conforms to the schema.

Prior art:
* [ReLLM](https://github.com/r2d4/rellm)
* [ParserLLM](https://github.com/r2d4/parserllm)
* [jsonformer](https://github.com/1rgs/jsonformer)
